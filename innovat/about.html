            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>The Power of an Idea</h2>

            <p>“A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules.” (Christopher Nolan, <i>Inception</i>) How far can it go? We live in a world that values actions over ideas. Either in a competitive world (I must be the best of the best) or in a non-competitive world (the most important thing is to take part) our actions are what define us to the eyes of the rest of the world.</p> <br>

            <p>However, at the genesis of every action, an idea is the origin of it. People have countless ideas all the time, one for every action or decision they take during their lives, but also many, many ideas that cannot be put into execution, perhaps because they are ridiculous, inappropriate, signs of some mental disease even. But among all of that mess, there are ideas that are worth being developed and supported. The human mind is a goldmine for progress and innovation, ideas and complex reasoning distinguish us from animals and allow us to make a difference.</p> <br>

            <p>At Innova-T, we strive for those ideas. Our whole reason to exist is to give the support that separates good ideas that would never be put into place, and life-changing ideas that will alter our world for the better. Much more than money, which any investor would be willing to give you for an idea, we offer our resources, experience and know-how to help you build a network of professionals to develop your projects, set up a team of our own specialists to help, or giving you and your cause a voice in the media so that public institutions are aware of what is on your mind, or the ones of many people like you, and react to cover your needs.</p> <br>

            <p>We believe on the ultraconnected world we live in being an advantage to make of these projects a multidisciplinary studies that take into account as many ponits of view as possible. In order to do that, our team will research your idea when you send it to us to examine possible initial links with different areas of expertise. To put you in a situation of success, we believe that your idea must be challenged to perfect it, and that will not happen with people that think just like you.</p> <br>

            <p>Lastly, we create our own content for educational purposes. Our partnership with #WHYMAPS allows us to make thorough, unbiased, reliable material for the new generations to understand some of our present and future struggles, as well as the possible direction of the solutions, and the revolutionary ideas that come to our attention. #WHYMAPS and our own team of content creators and researchers come up with story-like structures to make it amusing for those teenagers who start to show curiosity about how the real world works.</p><br>
