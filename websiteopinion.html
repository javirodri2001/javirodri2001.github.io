    <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a>: A simple, elegant webpage design that loads quickly despite the enormous quantity of information stored in it. Updated to the latest HTML and CSS versions, it uses a logical organiation with different lines for every product, each line having different columns according to different designs. Although there are a lot of categories in the menu section that display when we click on each feature in the top menu, the terminology is simple, which allows the user to navigate easily. The predominant color is white, which allows them to have some neutrality in the use of color for their designs later, as well as bringing them up in the pictures. What I think is their most special feature is the Nike ID section, which allows to customize some of the designs, and even if you, like me, cannot spend a lot of money on buying your own designs, it is still something that one can play around with. <br><br>

    <a href="https://hokkaidoramen.life/helena/">Hokkaido</a> (only Helena restaurant): considering that I know the owner does not spend much money on the business at all, I do like what he has been able to get from their webpage builder. They have a simple webpage, straight to the point and with no distractions. It is updated to the latest versions of both HTML and CSS, organized in a 1 column layout with multiple pics of the dishes offered. It is super easy to move around it and allows for online orders. The black and red colors and the pretty cool logo they have express elegance and brings out the color of the food, in photos that are much better sized than the ones you can often see in McDonalds, for example. An excellent webpage in my opinion, assuming that they do not spend too much money on it.<br><br>

    <a href="https://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>: a truly terrible website, this design leaves you thinking if your router is working properly or not. I found this webpage number 1 a list named "BAD WEBSITES â€“ THE 40 WORST WEBSITES ON THE WEB" and it is up there for a reason. I have no idea what place this is supposed to be for by looking at it, and if I do not know that, I cannot navigate properly. It is supposed to be easy for the user and it just isn't. At least, though, the webpage is updated to the latest HTML and CSS versions, but nobody cares about that if the site is this bad. Atrocious. Jeff Wald's worst nightmare. Uglier than punching your dad on the face on Father's day.
