    <h1>Review of State Websites</h1>
    <h3><i>By Javi Rodr√≠guez</i></h3>
    <br>

    <p>Today's assignment is to revise 5 different state websites and find what is good and bad of them. Based on my findings, I was asked to order them by preference, explaining in detail why I would pick one website over another. Below you can see the 5 websites I reviewed and my reasons why I ordered them in this specific way.</p>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://oklahoma.gov/">Oklahoma:</a> It seems like this webpage has been rebuilt, and I have to say they did a good job with it. Their new site looks dynamic and modern, nothing like the crappy webpages that I had to go through for immigration issues back when I applied for my student VISA. Some really cool pictures can be found all around the webpage, and the spaces between paragraphs makes reading the articles much easier to me. For navigation, there are a "Find my Agency" button and a search bar available, but I wish they had some tags for the most general issues that people visit the page for. That way, articles from the local news or public announcements could fill the space that some more general. The page loads its content quickly, it has good organization (although not my favorite) and it is resizable, which makes it easy to use on the phone, and the code is well organized. The only real issue that I have with this webpage, other than the tags which is not that big of a thing, is that the link that says "file your taxes" seems to redirect to a section of the old webpage, and let's just say that I understand perfectly why they decided to rebuild it. Other than that, it is a really solid webpage.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa:</a> Really close to Oklahoma in my opinion, the difference for me is just on the lack of images, since both of them have minor errors. The background image used is so cool though, and that makes me wonder why they did not put more of them. The page is resizable and the code is well organized, plus the content loads quickly. There is, though, one annoying mistake for OCD brains like myself with the tags. Under the "general" tag, the one that is supposed to say "birth, marriage or death certificate" is cut and I can't read the whole thing. It is just annoying to see such a careless mistake in an otherwise really well built webpage. In terms of navigation, this page is probably the best one by a landslide, they even invested on a virtual assistant that, although I do not appreciate all that much, is always a nice tool to have. I probably do not have much reason to put Iowa second to Oklahoma, but I really think images are a big part of a webpage that need to be there to make a webpage attractive, and sadly Iowa does not have any. Either way, it is a really good webpage regardless.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/">Vermont:</a> Although Vermont, to me, has a worse webpage than Tennessee for computers, it has the edge over it because I relly seems to be great for the smartphone users. The images that are clustered all together in the computer version, arraange themselves in a much more sophisticated way for the mobile version. As every other webpage in the list, content loading is very quick and its code is organized. The navigation is really annoying, though. The tags are not really specific ("Explore" could be so many different things in a government context) and they cover the whole screen. Also, since they decided to have some lines to describe each option in the tags, they misuse a lot of the space, which they could use to get more links instead of having to put a link showing all the list for each tag. I would just let people click on the tag and redirect them to the page straight away for thet, either you do it well or not at all. Also, I do not think any user really needs a poster size picture of Governor Scott, that is just narcissistic to me. I do not think it makes stuff harder to find most of the time, but it sure annoys me to have to click or scroll so much more for stuff that should be easy to find just because I have to scroll past some dude's face and his whole team to get to the VT-Alert section. Just get an "About" section and have it there for whoever that wants to look at it. Great on the phone, weird to use on the computer.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee:</a> This one is not really a bad webpage, but I do think it is a little boring looking, and it has what I think is a major issue with the tabs, which is that they are super small and are already hard enough to read on the computer, let alone to read and click on the cellphone. On the bright side though, I really like the news banner that moves sideways, and appreciate the fact that it is at the top of the page, and also they bothered to get many images around the webpage, all of them with good quality. It is a shame really, because in my opinion if it had bigger tabs it would make it so much better and easier to use, especially on the phone.</li>
        <li><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska:</a> By far the worst webpage on the list. Round corners and a narrow space containing all the content, is it still 2005 and no one told me? I guess that is the reason why this webpage is not resizable then, since smartphones were not a thing yet. It just looks super old anywhere you look, reminds me of the old Oklahoma webpage mentioned earlier. It does have a relatively good navigation, but I cannot understand why the state employees' tag is taking space from the tag that everyone, and mostly not workers, uses for Alaska issues. Why is it not hidden somewhere that only employees can get into, maybe somewhere they have to login into? Other than that the tags are actually really good, to the point that many of the content that you can find when you scroll is redundant almost. Meanwhile, no news on the home page, that is just not okay. To finish it all, not a single image in sight. Someone please explain me how a place like Alaska, with so much cool wildlife and nature environment, has no images at all on their official webpage. I do not get it. They literally get the Aurora Borealis, which is incredibly cool and unique to see, yet I would never know it if it was for the website. It is like they are hiding it from potential visitors. To sum it up, the webpage works, but it is so poorly built. I think no one touched it in the last 10 years when it comes to web design.</li>
