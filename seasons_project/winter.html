            <p><img src="winter-tree.png" class="tree"> In Spanish, we call seasons "estaciones" which translated literally means "stations." If we translated literally from one language another, one could say that Helena actually has only two "stations": the winter station and the train station. I can get behind that. In fact, this is what we Spanish people say about the city of Burgos, a place where it gets very cold, but not even close to what I have experienced here. There is no such thing here as too much winter clothes. Except, of course, if you were born and raised here, in which case you are probably genetically modified to make it through negative degrees on a light blazer and no gloves or hat, just like my former roommate. Blows my mind, I would die on my way to the STAC if I tried that.</p>
