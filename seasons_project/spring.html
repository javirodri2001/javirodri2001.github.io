            <p><img src="spring-tree.png" class="tree">Spring is what happens after Frebruary between one snowstorm and the next one. You may believe that the weather will get better. You think wrong. Weather does not get better, you just get used to it. No trees or plants ever grow flowers during this time of the year, because for the most part Helena still looks like Elsa's playground. (Frozen reference, Jeff, you should tell your kids) If you want to do some outdoor activities that don't involve sled dogs, now is the time. You may even unbotton your coat now, crazy times. If you happen to be able to enjoy Spring Break, go somewhere warm like Florida and have some fun while getting some vitamin D as well. If you live here, I guarantee you will have a lack of it by this time of the year.</p>
