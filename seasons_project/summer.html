            <p><img src="summser-tree.png" class="tree">There is a myth that says there is something in Helena that can be equivalent to summer, with hot temperatures and a lot of sun. I seriously do not believe it, but if that were true, maybe you can finally put on some swimming suits if you recall what they were by this time of the year, drill a hole through the ice on the nearest lake and swim for a while. Please send me some pictures of the summer in Montana, I bet it is the only time of the year in which I can wear sandals without sacrificing my toes in the process. Chances are I can go to the lake without wearing mittens. Must be nice if true. Enjoy such miracle of nature aka global warming sadly.</p>
