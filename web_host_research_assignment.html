    <h1>Web Host Research Assignment</h1>
    <h3><i>By Javi Rodr√≠guez</i></h3>
    <br>
    <p>For the purposes of this assignment, I am going to impersonate a small business owner that is looking for the web host that suits his needs the best, while also spending as little money as possible. In this case, I am looking for the best web host to start my business webpage. Figuring that I am only going to make one webpage and also the fact that my website management skills are limited, I will compare the most basic options from each web host unless some super interesting offer is shown at one of the web host webpages.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here are the three websites between which I am trying to make a decision:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost:</a> The Basic Plan, offered from $2.95 a month during a 36-month span, uses a technology called Shared Hosting, by which many different websites share the same host in order to keep the costs down while still offering good service. A 1 year free domain (.com, .net and .org among other options available) is included in the deal, alongside a free CDN (Content Delivery Network) to make loading times slower to the visitors, 50 GB SSD storage, custom themes that can help me, an unskilled person in the areas of website development and web design with the initial setup of the page itself, and 24/7 customer support. Within the Shared Hosting programs, I also have the option, as of January 27, 2021 offered at $5.45, to eventually upgrade to the Choice Plus option, which gives me the right to host unlimited websites with unlimited storage, free domain privacy and 1 year of free automated backup an interesting choice to make if or when my business grows enough to make sense to build a second website or to just add more features onto the first website. All of the plans at this web host include SSL certificates as well, which according to the website means that encrypted connections are created when it comes to the traffic of sensitive data to ensure that data is safe.</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy:</a> Its Economy plan, offered at $5.99 a month initially and $8.99 a month after the first renewal, includes 100 GB of storage for one website, a maximum of 10 databases to include, unlimited bandwidth to ensure that the data transfer between the server and the visitors is as quick as possible, and a free 1-click WordPress install that someone with limited website development skills like me would appreciate in order to get the webpage up and running as fast as possible, even if I develop my web design skills later and I decide to make some changes to it myself. Also, a 1 year free Office 365 email and a free domain would be included in the deal. (.com, .net and .org among other options available)</li>
        <br>
        <li><a href="https://www.ionos.com/">IONOS by 1&1:</a></li> The Essential Plan is supposed to be the most suitable for my current situation, and it is offered for $4 a month through the first year and then for $6 dollars a month after that. However, I believe that my business is going to take off rather quickly in the Internet, so I want to comment a special offer that IONOS is making to new customers for their Business plan, which is offered at only $1 a month through the first year, and after that at $10 dollars a month. It offers unlimited storage, websites and databases on it, a professional email with 2 GB mailbox, 1 year free domain (.com, .net and .org among other options available) and an increased CPU and memory resources over the Essential Plan. Security features include 1 SSL certificate, daily backup on websites and databases and data recovery, among others.
    </ul>

    <p>At first, I was quite pleased with the Bluehost service because it looked like something nice and easy that would be quick to get me started, after which I would have the opportunity to learn about website development and develop my business before upgrading to a version with more features. However, seeing the plan they had at IONOS, I think that it can be a better option to have all those features now and invest more of my time in building a more elaborated website, specially having a whole year of reduced payments to play around and learn code, after which I can always back off if I feel it is not worth it by the end of it. Therefore, my pick would be the Business pack from IONOS.</p>
